# entropy

`entropy` is a simple command-line tool to calculate the entropy of files.

## Why

The [entropy of a file](https://kennethghartman.com/blog/calculate-file-entropy/) tells us how random this file is.
The closer to `8.00`, the more random is an input file.

As compression and encryption algorithms output usually consists of high entropy data, one can say
any file with entropy `greater than 7.0` is likely compressed, encrypted, or packed (in case of executables).

I needed a fast way to calculate the entropy for a couple of files at once in Windows, so I ended up coding
this tool, which also supports Linux and macOS.

## Download

Windows releases are available [here](https://github.com/merces/entropy/releases). In order to run them, you need the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
installed.

For Linux and macOS see the [Building](#Building) section.

## Usage

Calculating the entropy of a single file:

```bash
$ ./entropy /bin/ls
5.85 /bin/ls
```

Shell expansion is supported too:

```powershell
PS C:\> .\entropy.exe C:\Users\User\Downloads\*
7.92 C:\Users\User\Downloads\1.jpeg
8.00 C:\Users\User\Downloads\setup.exe
7.58 C:\Users\User\Downloads\nov.pptx
4.66 C:\Users\User\Downloads\data.bin
7.99 C:\Users\User\Downloads\pic.png
4.07 C:\Users\User\Downloads\budget.xls
```

From the above output one could say `/bin/ls` is not packed, `1.jpeg` uses compression,
`setup.exe` is compressed, `nov.pptx` is compressed (yup, these modern MS Office files are all
ZIP files indeed), `data.bin` is not compressed, etc. Is that garuanteed? No, it's just math. :nerd_face:

## Building

### Linux/macOS

Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/merces/entropy.git
$ cd entropy

If you have CMake installed, build with:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Or if you don't, just use `g++`:

```bash
$ g++ -std=c++20 -o entropy entropy.cpp
```

### Windows

If you use a recent Visual Studio version, you can clone this repository and open the `CMakeLists.txt` here
with `File -> Open -> CMake...`. Then, select a configuration that suits your needs and build.
